**Arrow functions**
- They are another way to write functions, but with a simplified syntax. 
- With those kind of functions we can easy manage callbacks
- When we have one line of code we can avoid the word *RETURN to return an element 

- The scope of the reserved word *THIS changes. There is no context at the moment to executes the 

**Classes**
We can define a class as a template used to create objects defined from the same base structure. 
Objects derived from this template are known as class instances(objects). 

- Each class is an abstraction that defines a set of attributes and methods that compose it.

- CONSTRUCTOR : This method defines the initial properties of the obejct based on the arguments it receives. 
- PROPERTIES : The properties are variables found within a class and contain information about the state of an object 
- METHODS: Methods are functions defined within a class that describe the actions or behaviors of objects created from that class
- INSTANCE : Is a specific object created from a class.


**Encapsulation**
Encapsulation is the principle of hiding the internal details of an object's implementation, exposing only 
the interfaces necessary to interact with it. This ensure data integrity and implementation security.

**Inheritance**
Is a principle that allows a class to derive properties and methods from another class, promoting code reuse and 
hierarchy in class structuring. We must to use the reserved word *EXTENDS 

**Polymorsphism**
Is a capability that allows objects of different classes to respond to methods with the same name, each according to its own implementation.

**Abstraction**
Is the process of hiding the complex details of the implementation and exposing only the essential featuresa and functionalities of an object.
